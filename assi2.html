            <li>Shahaji Raje Bhosle and Jijabai's second son, Shivaji was born in February 1630. Her elder son Sambhaji lived with his father and had died in a war at an young age. In his elder brother's memory, Shivaji Raje named his elder son as Sambhaji Raje.</li>
            <li>When Shivaji was 14 years old, Shahaji Raje handed over the Jagir of Pune to him. The responsibility of managing the Jagir fell on Jijabai.</li>
            <li>Jijabai and Shivaji Raje arrived in Pune with skilled officers. Due to the persistent interests of Nizamshah, Adilshah and Mughals, the condition of Pune was very bad. Under such adverse circumstances, she redeveloped the city of Pune. </li>

        <li>When Jijabai's husband Shahaji Raje died, she decided to sacrifice herself according to the Sati tradition, but Shivaji Maharaj opposed it and prevented her from performing sati.

            She died on 17 June 1674 at Pachad village near Raigad Fort. At that time it was only twelve days since the coronation of Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj.
